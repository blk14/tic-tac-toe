# x-0-game
This is a implementation for the x&0 game in c++. For playing it you have to choose if you want to start, then to insert the coordinates for "x" (by default you play with x and computer with "0").  The implementation tries to win or to be very hard to be beaten. For it there is a check function which decide if the game is end. "Check" function checks each posibility for 3 elements to be in  row or if the matrix is full, in this cases results that the game is end. The function "fill" is the function which puts elements for the computer an decide where to put it based on the information given by the "danger" function which return the coordinates where is a posibility to end the game (where there are 2 elements in a row and the player wait for the third). If there is not this danger the "fill" function tries to create a posibility like that and decide to put element where is a perspective to put 3 in a row, if it is not possible too, then it put the element where is possible.
